# To-DOList-WEBAPP
The To-Do List project is an application specially built to keep track of our daily routine or tasks that need to be done on time. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. Once they are done with their tasks they can also remove them from the list.
